            <a name="modes"><p id="header">Vim Modes</p></a>
			<ul>
				<li><u>Command Mode</u>:
					This is the default mode when opening a file for the first
					time. From here, you cannot enter text without first
					entering Insert mode. From this mode, you can issue navigation 
					search, insert, open, or append commands (see Navigation
					under Basics: Command Mode).  
				</li>
				<li><u>Insert Mode (i)</u>:
					Access this mode by issuing an insert, open, or append
					command. From here, you can directly input text into the
					file or use the arrow keys to navigate the file. In other
					words, Insert mode in Vim looks very much like any other
					text editor. Press the Esc key to return to Command Mode.
				</li>
				<li><u>Last Line Mode (:)</u>:
				Access this mode by pressing the colon : key. In this mode, you
				can search for a particular string, use regular expressions to
				search and replace, save file and quit Vim session, open
				additional files, jump to a specific line, and more.
				</li>
			</ul>

            <a name="basics"><p id="header">Basics: Command Mode</p></a>
			<ul>
				<li><u>Navigation</u>:
					<ul>
						<li>j = Move cursor down 1 line</li>
						<li>k = Move cursor up 1 line</li>
						<li>h = Move cursor left 1 character</li>
						<li>l = Move cursor right 1 character</li>
						<li>w = Move cursor right 1 word (punctuation considered a word)</li>
						<li>b = Move cursor left 1 word</li>
						<li>W = Move cursor right 1 word (spaces separate words)</li>
						<li>B = Move cursor left 1 word (spaces separate words)</li>
						<li>$ = Move cursor to end of line</li>
						<li>0 (numeric zero) = Move cursor to beginning of line</li>
						<li>gg = Move cursor to first line in the file</li>
						<li>G = Move cursor to last line in the file</li>
						<li>ctrl+f = Scroll page down towards end of file</li>
						<li>ctrl+b = Scroll page up towards top of file</li>
					</ul>
				</li> 
				<li><u>Insert</u>:
				Press the i key to enable text insertion before the current
				cursor location. Pressing I will enable text insertion at the
				beginning of the current line. Navigating a file in this
				mode requires use of the arrow keys, as keys in this mode will
				operate as normal. Return to Command Mode with the Esc key.
				</li>
				<li><u>Append</u>:
				Press the a key to append to current cursor location. If you
				want to add text to the end of a line, you can move your cursor
				to the last character of the line, then press a. OR, you can
				press A to automatically move the cursor to the end of the line
				and enter Insert Mode. Return to Command Mode with the Esc key.  
				</li>
				<li><u>Open</u>:
				Press o to insert a new line above the cursor. Press shift+o to
				insert a new line below the cursor. Return to Command Mode with
				the Esc key.  
				</li>
				<li><u>Delete Chars, Words, Lines</u>:
					<ul>
						<li>x = Delete single character under cursor</li>
						<li>dw = Delete a single word (punctuation considered a
						word).</li>
						<li>dW = Delete a single word (spaces separate
						words)</li> 
						<li>dd = Delete current line</li>
						<li>Ad = Delete line number A
						<li>A,Bd = Delete lines in range A to B</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><u>Copy a Line or Multiple Lines</u>: 
				Press yy to copy the current line and
				1,10y to copy lines 1 through 10. Move cursor to desired
				location, and press p to paste the line(s) below the current
				cursor location and P to paste the line(s) above.
					<ul>
						<li>yy = Copy current line</li>
						<li>Ayy = Copy line number A</li>
						<li>A,By = Copy lines in range A to B</li>
					</ul>
				<li><u>Replace</u>:
					<ul>
						<li>rX = Replace single character under cursor with
						letter, punctuation, or number specified by X</li>
						<li>R = Replace continuous set of characters. Exit with
						Esc key.</li> 
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><u>Delete and Insert</u>: 
				Use the s key to delete a specific number of characters and
				automatically enter Insert Mode (one less step than using the x
				key followed by i). Use c to delete a word and automatically
				enter Insert Mode.
					<ul>
						<li>s = Delete single character under cursor and
						automatically enter Insert Mode</li>
						<li>Xs = Delete X characters from cursor and
						automatically enter Insert Mode, where X is a numeric
						value</li>
						<li>cw = Delete single word (punctuation considered a
						word) and automatically enter Insert Mode</li>
						<li>cW = Delete single word (spaces separate words) and
						automatically enter Insert Mode</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><u>Cut and Paste Lines</u>: 
				Press dd or A,Bd to delete (and
				subsequently, cut) the current line or a range of lines. These
				become stored in your Vim buffer. If you want to paste those
				lines somewhere else, you must not issue any other commands in
				Insert or Command Mode, which will remove the previously
				deleted lines from the buffer. Press p to paste the cut line(s)
				below the cursor position and P to paste them above.
				</li>
			</ul>

            <p id="header">Basics: Insert Mode</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u>Paste Code Unmodified</u>:
				In some cases if you copy example code from a webpage, and
				paste it in Vim insert mode, Vim will paste text unexpectedly
				and incorrectly indent several lines. Use the paste option to
				paste unmodified code from outside applications, such as the
				Internet. Use :set paste to put Vim in Paste Mode. Use 
				:set nopaste to exit Paste Mode.
				</li>
			</ul>

            <p id="header">Basics: Last Line Mode</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u>Saving File</u>:
				Press :w to save the file with the current filename. If you'd
				rather save the file under a different name, press 
				:w <filename>.
				</li> 
				<li><u>Quit Vim Session</u>:
				Press :q to terminate the current Vim session. If there are
				unsaved local changes to the current file, Vim will issue a 
				warning indicating that there are changes. If you want to
				discard any changes, press :q!. Otherwise, press :w first to
				save the file.  
				</li> 
				<li><u>Write and Quit</u>:
				You can combine the above two commands by pressing :wq, where w
				indicates saving the file with the current filename, and q
				indicates ending the Vim session. You can still save to a
				different filename and quit the Vim session simultaneously by
				pressing :wq <filename>.  
				</li>

            <a name="favorites"><p id="header">Favorites</p></a>
			<ul>
				<li><u>Quickly Delete Contents Enclosed in Brackets</u>:
				To delete all contents enclosed between brackets, such as a
				function definition between curly brackets, for loop conditions
				in parentheses, C++ templating in angle brackets, or even a
				long string contained between quotation marks, use di
				(stands for delete inside) immediately followed by the open or
				closed bracket that contains the text you wish to delete.
				</li>
				<li><u>Search and Replace Using Cursor Location</u>:
				Instead of using a range of line numbers for regular
				expressions, you can also use the cursor location. Say you want
				to insert a comment from line 50 to the last line. You can
				issue :.,$s/^/#/.  Here, the "." indicates current line, and
				the dollar symbol ($) indicates the last line. Note that the
				"." and $ symbols are still separated by a comma, much like
				when you're using a range of line numbers. To add a comment to
				the current line and the next 9 lines (i.e., add a comment to
				10 lines total), use :.,+9s/^/#/. To apply to the current line
				and the previous 9 lines, use :.,-9s/^/#/.
				</li>
				<li><u>Visual Block Mode</u>:
				Seamlessly delete, add, or modify a single column in a text
				file. Enter this mode with ctrl+v.
				</li>
			</ul>

            <a name="advanced"><p id="header">Advanced: Command Mode</p></a>
			<ul>
				<li><u>Join Two Lines</u>:
				Press J to join two lines together. More
				specifically, this command will append the next line with the
				current line from where this command was executed. Could also
				be achieved by entering Insert Mode, then using the Delete or
				Backspace key.  
				</li>
				<li><u>Jump Between Matching Brackets</u>:
				Use shift+5 (%) to move the cursor between matching sets of
				brackets. This could be used to ensure you've closed the
				brackets on your for loop or to find the matching bracket of a
				function that doesn't fit in the Vim window.
				</li>
				<li><u>Searching Within a File</u>:
				To search for a string from current location to the bottom of
				the file, press /string, followed by the Enter key. To search
				from bottom to top, use ?string. There are various settings in
				your .vimrc that can highlight matching strings, or that will
				dynamically move the cursor from through your file as your type
				your search. Use n to advance to the next match, and use N to
				go back to the previous match. Use g* to search the word under
				the cursor.
				</li>
				<li><u>Delete Chars</u>:
				Use Xd, where X is the number of characters to delete from the
				current cursor location. Use Xs to delete X number of
				characters and automatically be placed in Insert Mode.
				</li>
				<li><u>"." Command</u>: 
				This command simplifies your ability to repeat commands without
				retyping them for each occurrence. The "." command repeats the
				last change made in regular mode, such as deleting a word (dw)
				or inserting a word in Insert Mode.
				</li>
				<li><u>Jump to Definition</u>:
				Move cursor to a variable instance or function call, then press
				gD to move your cursor to the global defintion, and gd to move
				to the local declaration.
				</li>
				<li><u>Indent Single Line or Block of Lines</u>:
				Double tap the greater than (>) or less than (<) symbols to
				indent or un-indent a line, respectively. To indent or un-indent
				a block of lines, add any number before the greater than or
				less than symbols. This number indicates how many lines from
				the current lines you wish you indent or unindent.
				</li>
				<li><u>Quickly Delete Contents Enclosed in Brackets</u>:
				To delete all contents enclosed between brackets, such as a
				function definition between curly brackets, for loop conditions
				in parentheses, C++ templating in angle brackets, or even a
				long string contained between quotation marks, use di
				(stands for delete inside) immediately followed by the open or
				closed bracket that contains the text you wish to delete.
				</li>
				<li><u>Toggle Between Upper and Lower Case</u>:
				Quickly toggle a character between upper and lower case by
				pressing the ~ key (shift+`). Repeatedly press this key across
				an entire word, and Vim will automatically advance your cursor
				from one character to the next. If there is a blank character
				(or space), the toggling will do nothing, but advance your 
				cursor.
				</li>
				<li><u>Recording</u>:
				I have never used this feature, but something I always found
				myself in when I was learning Vim, and couldn't figure out how
				I activated it. If you press the q key followed by any letter
				[a-z], subsequent keystrokes will be recorded to the register
				uniquely identified by the letter, and can be replayed with
				@[a-z]. If you accidentally find yourself activating this
				feature or you want to stop recording commands, press q in
				Command Mode.  
				</li>
			</ul>

            <p id="header">Advanced: Last Line Mode</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u>Jump to Specific Line</u>:
				If line numbers are not enabled, you may want to enable them in
				the current Vim session with :set nu, which will make it easier
				to identify the line number. Type :set nonu to toggle line
				numbers off. If you want line numbers to be enabled for all Vim
				sessions, add "set nu" to a Vim configuration file named .vimrc
				(yes, with the leading .).  Then, to move your cursor to a
				particular line, enter :X, where X is the line number of
				interest. Hit Enter to execute command.
				</li>
				<li><u>Regular Expressions</u>:
				The format of regular expressions is s/<pattern>/<string>/g. By
				including the g at the end of the regular expression, the
				regular expression will be applied globally to the current
				line. In other words, it will search and replace all
				occurrences of the pattern in the
				line. By removing the g, it will only replace the first
				occurrence. To apply the same regular expression to multiple
				lines, add a range before the regular expression, separated by
				a comma. 
				</li>
				<li><u>Search and Replace Using Cursor Location</u>:
				Instead of using a range of line numbers for regular
				expressions, you can also use the cursor location. Say you want
				to insert a comment from line 50 to the last line. You can
				issue :.,$s/^/#/.  Here, the "." indicates current line, and
				the dollar symbol ($) indicates the last line. Note that the
				"." and $ symbols are still separated by a comma, much like
				when you're using a range of line numbers. To add a comment to
				the current line and the next 9 lines (i.e., add a comment to
				10 lines total), use :.,+9s/^/#/. To apply to the current line
				and the previous 9 lines, use :.,-9s/^/#/.
				</li>
				<li><u>Comment Out Multiple Lines</u>:
				You can use regular expressions to comment out several lines of
				code, assuming you don't want to use a block comment like in
				C/C++ (/* multi-lined comment */) or if the programming
				language doesn't have block comments like in Bash scripting (#
				comment).  
				So, to comment out lines 2-10, for example, in Bash, the syntax
				would be :2,10s/^/#/. The caret symbol here indicates
				"beginning of line". To comment out these same lines in C/C++,
				issue the command :2,10s/^/\/\/. When using the forward-slash
				symbol in regular expressions, you must escape the character
				(hence the backslash) for it to be interpreted correctly. To
				remove the comment, issue the command :2,10s/^#//, which says
				"for every pound symbol at the beginning of the line, replace
				it with nothing." And, to remove a single-lined comment in
				C/C++, :2,10s/^\/\///. And a :%s/^/#/ will add a # symbol to
				every line in the file.
				</li>
				<li><u>Delete All Lines in File</u>:
				Press :%d to delete all lines in the current file. Here, the
				% symbol represents all lines , and the d indicates delete.
				</li>
				<li><u>Edit Additional Files From Current Vim Session</u>:
				With the current file open in Vim, open additional files in
				individual buffers with :e filename, where e stands for edit
				and filename could be an
				existing file or a new files you would like to create. Buffers
				are an easy way to cut or copy code from one file to another
				without having to move away from the keyboard. Another great
				feature of buffers is that the previous command entered in to
				file A could easily be applied to file B with the "." command,
				since history is carried over. Buffers are labeled numerically,
				starting at one. Switch to the next sequential buffer with :bn.
				To go back to the previous file, use :bN. Vim will warn you if
				you have reached either end of the available buffers. You can
				also jump to a specific buffer with :bX, where X is the number
				of the buffer of interest. You will not be able to jump to a
				non-existing buffer. Close open buffers with :bw. Word of
				caution: w does NOT stand for write, but will ignore any
				changes. If you want to save your changes, you must first save
				the file with :w.
				</li>
				<li><u>Open Multiple Files</u>:
				Multiple files can be opened in a single Vim session by listing
				each filename from the command line separated by a space. Each
				of these files is opened in a buffer, as described above. You
				can advance to the next file (buffers are referenced
				numerically) with :n or :bn, and go back to the previous file
				with :N or :bN. Close buffers with :bw, but make sure you have
				saved any changes beforehand. You can also still move between
				files using the specific buffer number.
				</li>
				<li><u>Remove Highlighting</u>:
				Use :noh (no highlighting) to disable any syntax highlighting
				in Vim.
				</li>
			</ul>

            <p id="header">Advanced: Miscellaneous</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u>Remap Esc Key to Caps Lock Key</u>:
				The Esc key is one of the most commonly used keys to a Vim user
				since it enables you to switch between Insert and Command Mode.
				On a typical keyboard, the Esc key is a far stretch from the
				home keys, which may cause some strain. I decided to remap the
				Esc key to the Caps Lock key, a key I don't use too often.
				</li>
				<li><u>Suspend Vim Session</u>:
				Temporarily suspend or background your Vim session, returning
				you to the command line as if you had ended the session. When
				you open a file in Vim, the OS automatically creates a swap
				(.swp) file, and when you close the file, the file is deleted.
				When the swap file exists, Vim will warn you that there is
				already a copy of the file being edited if you try and open the
				same file. Return to the Vim session with fg (foreground).
				</li>
				<li><u>Visual Mode and Visual Block Mode</u>:
					<ul>
						<li>Enter Visual Mode per character with the v key. If
						you move press the navigation keys, you'll see that
						your cursor starts highlighting in its past. Any
						Command Mode keystroke you press will be applied to
						this highlighted region, so you'll be able to delete or
						copy the entire block, for example.  
						</li>
						<li>Enter Visual Block Mode with ctrl+v. This feature
						is especially useful for modifying column-formatted text.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><u>Formatting Based on Vimrc</u>:
				I prefer to have every line in Vim to be at max 80 characters
				wide. When I'm writing text, sometimes my cursor won't
				automatically wrap the current line, so I reformat it by
				pressing gqj. Apparently, I could solve this issue and not have
				to use this command anymore according to this <a href"http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Automatic_word_wrapping">article</a>, but I have yet to try it out.
				</li>
				<li><u>Access Man Pages</u>:
